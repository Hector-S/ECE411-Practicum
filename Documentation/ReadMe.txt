#1 Rule: Only increment A, B, or C only once per update.
i.e. No matter how big or small your change/s were, only increment A, B, or C once.

A.BC
A = Extreme revision. Document looks or holds a lot of different info.
If B = 9 and another Major Revision is made, set B = 0 and increment A.

B = Major Revision: Sections were removed/added/ or heavily edited.
B can have a max value of 9.

C = Minor Revision: Format fixes or typo/grammar fixes.
C can be any value.
Example: 3.027 (C = 27)
