Competition against this device would be other education tools/toys for 
digital coding. Our product is different/stands out because it will be affordable
for most family incomes and will allow students or even professionals to get hands
on experience with digital coding and electrical hardware that can also be translated
into the real world. Our product will be marketed to music lovers and future/current
S.T.E.M advocates.
